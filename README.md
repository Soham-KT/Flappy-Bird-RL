This repository contains a reinforcement learning (RL) implementation of the Flappy Bird game. The RL agent is trained using Deep Q-Learning, enabling it to learn and master the game by avoiding obstacles and surviving as long as possible.

## Features

- **Deep Q-Learning**: Utilizes a neural network to approximate the Q-value function.
- **Flappy Bird Environment**: The classic Flappy Bird game recreated in a Python environment.
- **Training and Testing Modes**: Allows training the RL agent from scratch or testing a pre-trained model.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Easy to modify hyperparameters like learning rate, discount factor, and more.
